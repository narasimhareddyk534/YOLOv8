# YOLOv8
The project is about the detection and count of different types of blood cells those are RBC,WBC,Plateltes in the blood using a microscopic image of a blood sample 

#Dataset
The dataset is taken from the Roboflow bccd dataset https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/bccd 

Dataset contain images and their corresponding bounding box txt file with same name

#train
Training is done with the retrain the yolov8s.pt model with our dataset

#Output
After successful completion of training a runs folder is created 
in that we got the trained model
